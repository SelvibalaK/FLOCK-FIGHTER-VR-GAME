# FLOCK-FIGHTER-VR-GAME
Welcome to FLOCK-FIGHTER-VR-GAME, a beginner-level 2D VR game crafted to help players understand how 2D VR works! 🚀 This project, developed entirely from scratch, focuses on simple controls and a dynamic challenge where players must dodge birds flying toward their character.

# 🕹️ Game Features
   * Simple Controls: Use the Up and Down arrow keys to move the player character.
   * Dynamic Challenge: Birds fly towards the player, and your objective is to dodge them.
   * Score System: Your score is based on how long you survive—each second adds to your score. If a bird touches you, the game ends and records your score based on your survival time.

# 🎮 Game Objective
   * Survive: Dodge the birds for as long as you can! The longer you last, the higher your score.
   * Game Over: If a bird touches your character, the game ends, and your score is displayed.
